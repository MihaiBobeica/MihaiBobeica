# Mihai Bobeica

I study Computer Science at TUDelft and Mathematics at VU Amsterdam. I aim to break into quantitative research by delivering real projects.

## Ambition
- Try as many roles across math and computer science as I can before graduating.
- Expand my quantitative skills by building focused, open-source projects.

## Highlights
- Placed 2nd in the Optiver Trading competition (TU Delft).
- Won a wildfire-prediction hackathon.
- Earned a Romanian Math Olympiad bronze medal.
- TA-ed the Machine Learning course.
- Investigated as part of the EDU-LLM Fellowship Project the optimal integration of LLMs in education.
- Organized the Qiskit Fall Fest 2025 at TU Delft.

## Experience
- **Helin (Energy Tech):** Investigate and build multi-camera, multi-object stitching; calibrate cameras; derive and chain homographies
- **ASML (Metrology):** Model wafer alignment, run numerical optimization, and develop internal tooling for wafer allignment research.

## Interests
I enjoy solving optimization problems, building numerical methods, designing research workflows, and applying computer vision to real systems.
