# Mihai Bobeica

I study Computer Science at TUDelft 🎓 and Mathematics at VU Amsterdam 📘. I aim to break into quantitative research by delivering real projects 📊.

## Ambition
- Try as many roles across math and computer science as I can before graduating 🧩.
- Expand my quantitative skills by building focused, open-source projects 💻.

## Highlights
- Placed 2nd 🥈 in the Optiver Trading competition (TU Delft).
- Won a wildfire-prediction hackathon 🔥.
- Earned a Romanian Math Olympiad bronze medal 🏅.
- TA-ed the Machine Learning course 🤖.
- Investigated as part of the EDU-LLM Fellowship Project the optimal integration of LLMs in education 📚.
- Organized the Qiskit Fall Fest 2025 at TU Delft ⚛️.

## Experience
- **Helin (Energy Tech):** Investigate and build multi-camera, multi-object stitching 🎥; calibrate cameras 📷; derive and chain homographies 🔗
- **ASML (Metrology):** Model wafer alignment 🎯, run numerical optimization 📐, and develop internal tooling for wafer alignment research 🧪.

## Interests
I enjoy solving optimization problems 🔢, building numerical methods 📏, designing research workflows 🛠️, and applying computer vision to real systems 👁️.
